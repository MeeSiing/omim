symbol	name	can_be_disease_or_phenotype	description
*	Asterisk	FALSE	An asterisk (*) before an entry number indicates a gene.
#	Number Sign	TRUE	A number symbol (#) before an entry number indicates that it is a descriptive entry, usually of a phenotype, and does not represent a unique locus. The reason for the use of the number symbol is given in the first paragraph of the entry. Discussion of any gene(s) related to the phenotype resides in another entry(ies) as described in the first paragraph.
+	Plus	TRUE	A plus sign (+) before an entry number indicates that the entry contains the description of a gene of known sequence and a phenotype.
%	Percent	TRUE	A percent sign (%) before an entry number indicates that the entry describes a confirmed mendelian phenotype or phenotypic locus for which the underlying molecular basis is not known.
	NULL	TRUE	No symbol before an entry number generally indicates a description of a phenotype for which the mendelian basis, although suspected, has not been clearly established or that the separateness of this phenotype from that in another entry is unclear.
^	Caret	TRUE	A caret (^) before an entry number means the entry no longer exists because it was removed from the database or moved to another entry as indicated.
